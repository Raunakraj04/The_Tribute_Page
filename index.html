        <h2>NETAJI</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Subhas Chandra Bose was born in a Bengali family on January 23, 1897, at Cuttak in Orissa. From the
            beginning, reading was a
            passion with Bose and he was greatly influenced by the writings of Swami Vivekananda. He went to England for
            further studies and on
            returning to India, went to join Gandhiji. But his ideas did not match with Gandhiji’s belief in
            non-violence. He felt that an armed
            struggle was the only way to end British Rule in India.

            So he left and returned to Calcutta to work under C.R. Das, the Bengali freedom fighter. In 1921, Netaji
            organised a boycott of the
            celebrations to mark the Prince of Wales visit to India. This led to his being imprisoned. Soon afterwards,
            Netaji was arrested again,
            as a suspected terrorist, and exiled to Mandalay in Burma.

            He was arrested numerous times. On one such occasion when he was under house arrest he escaped via
            Afghanistan to Berlin and then to
            Japan. Here within two years, he raised the Indian National Army (INA) or Azad Hind Fauj. His purpose was to
            defeat the British during
            World War II. In spite of the defeat of the Azad Hind Fauj, Netaji won an immortal place in Indian History.
            “Jai Hind” was his battle
            cry and he took the nation to great heights. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose died in a plane crash in 1945.
